street_suffixes:
  # "Suffixes" that are recognized categories of street, along with their USPS canonical abbreviation.
  # Note that all USPS-recognized suffixes must appear in this list, even if the suffix is its own abbreviation.
  # Thus, for example, "lndg" maps to "lndg".  We can use the suffix's presence in this list to help us parse
  # address1 fields by identifying a token that could plausibly be a street suffix.
